# Evaluate the following Python numerical expressions without the Python interpreter. You can use a calculator.
## Python Arithmetic Operators:
# multiplication
a = 9 * 5
# division
b = 15 / 12
c = 12 / 15
# floor divison; divides two number then rounds down to integer
d = 15 // 12
# modulus; remainder from the division of the first argument to the second
e = 9 % 5
f = 12 % 15
g = 6 % 6
# PEMDAS; order of operations
h = 2 + (3 -1) * 10 / 5 * (2 + 3)
## P – Parentheses  [{()}]
## E – Exponents (Powers and Roots)
## MD- Multiplication and Division (left to right) (× and ÷)
## AS – Addition  and Subtraction (left to right) (+ and -)
# exponentiation; 'to the power of'
i = 5 ** 2
j = 5 + (2 + 1) ** 2 ** 3
k = 16/2*(2+2)
