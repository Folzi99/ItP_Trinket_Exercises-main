# Create a program with (exactly) the following output. For the last line you will need to do the product of the 2 variables (not just printout the value 42).
## my first variable has a value of 7
## my second variable has a value of 6
## the product of these 2 variables is 42

var7 = 7
var6 = 6
var_mult = var6 * var7

print("my first variable has a value of ", var7)
print("my first variable has a value of ", var6)
print("my first variable has a value of ", var_mult)

# ---------

#What happens if you move the definition of one of your variable to the last line of your program? How the error message differs?

## ===> 'NameError: name '...' is not defined
