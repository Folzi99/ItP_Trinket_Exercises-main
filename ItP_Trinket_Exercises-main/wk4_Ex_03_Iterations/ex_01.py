# Write a program with the following output, using two 'for' loops. Hint: you have to use a list like the birthday example.

colors = ['Red', 'Blue', 'Green', 'Silver']
names = ['Sun', 'Moon', 'Sword', 'Shield']

for color in colors:
    print('I really liked Pokemon ', color, '!')
for name in names:
    print('Pokemon ', name, '...', '\n I did not really enjoyed it.', sep='')
